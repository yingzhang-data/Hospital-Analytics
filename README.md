**1.2 Objective**
* Encounters Overview: Examine Trends in patient encounter volume, types and lengths
* Cost & Coverage Insights: Insurance coverage, procedures and claim costs
* Patients Behavior Analysis: visit patterns,length of stay and readmissions


### 2. About Dataset

Data Source: Maven Data playground  
Data Format: CSV files  
Tables: Encounters, Patients, Payers, Procedures.

**Q2: For each year, what percentage of all encounters belonged to each encounter class (ambulatory, outpatient, wellness, urgent care, emergency, and inpatient)?**

<details>
<summary> Show SQL Query </summary>

```sql
SELECT 
	Year(START) AS yr,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN ENCOUNTERCLASS = "ambulatory" THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)/
    COUNT(*) * 100,1) AS ambulatory,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN ENCOUNTERCLASS = "outpatient" THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)/
    COUNT(*) * 100,1) AS outpatient,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN ENCOUNTERCLASS = "wellness" THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)/
    COUNT(*) * 100,1) AS wellness,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN ENCOUNTERCLASS = "urgentcare" THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)/
    COUNT(*) * 100,1) AS urgentcare,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN ENCOUNTERCLASS = "emergency" THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)/
    COUNT(*) * 100,1) AS emergency,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN ENCOUNTERCLASS = "inpatient" THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)/
    COUNT(*) * 100,1) AS inpatient
FROM encounters
GROUP BY yr
ORDER BY yr DESC;

**Q3: What percentage of encounters were over 24 hours versus under 24 hours?**

<details>
<summary> Show SQL Query </summary>

```sql
SELECT
	COUNT(TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR,START,STOP))
FROM encounters
WHERE TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR,START,STOP) >= 24;

SELECT
	COUNT(TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR,START,STOP))
FROM encounters
WHERE TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR,START,STOP) < 24;

SELECT
	ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR,START,STOP) >= 24 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)/
      COUNT(*) * 100,1) AS over_24_hours,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR,START,STOP) < 24 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)/
      COUNT(*) * 100,1) AS under_24_hours
FROM encounters;
```

Objective 2: Cost & Coverage Insights  
* How many encounters had zero payer coverage, and what percentage of total encounters does this represent?
* What are the top 10 most frequent procedures performed and the average base cost for each?
* What are the top 10 procedures with the highest average base cost and the number of times they were performed?
* What is the average total claim cost for encounters, broken down by payer?

Objective 3: Patients Behavior Analysis  
* How many unique patients were admitted each quarter over time?
* How many patients were readmitted within 30 days of a previous encounter?
* Which patients had the most readmissions?
