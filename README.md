# Hospital Analytics

### 1. Introduction
**1.1 Context**  
As a data analyst at a healthcare analytics consulting firm, I have been tasked with supporting Massachusetts General Hospital in preparing their annual performance report. our analysis focuses on patient encounters, costs, insurance coverage, and behavioral trends to support planning and improve care delivery and optimizing hospital operations.

**1.2 Objective**
* Encounters Overview: Examine Trends in patient encounter volume, types and lengths
* Cost & Coverage Insights: Insurance coverage, procedures and claim costs
* Patients Behavior Analysis: visit patterns,length of stay and readmissions


### 2. About Dataset
The analysis is based on Synthetic data on ~1k patients of Massachusetts General Hospital  
Data Source: Maven Data playground  
Data Format: CSV files  
Tables: Encounters, Patients, Payers, Procedures.  
Number of records: 75592  
Number of fields: 55 unique fields across all tables
